# Match Predictor

This project uses different prediction models to find the best accuracy of future NBA games by learning from past games. Games from 2025 were used to predict future games. Game winners were determined using team stats, player data, and injuries. Models such as SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest were used to get a best accuracy of 70%.
